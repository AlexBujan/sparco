tokyo: 
cython blas wrapper that's used by quasinewton, see https://github.com/tokyo/tokyo

to build the modules: 

- find cblas.h on your system (e.g. using the locate function)
- set $BLASPATH to point to the directory cblas.h is in, e.g.
export BLASPATH="/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/Headers/"
- make all


With a fresh Anaconda install, need to:
- conda install cython
- conda install mpi4py
